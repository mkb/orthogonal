title: Rules of thumb
---
Quoth [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb):
>A rule of thumb is a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for approximately calculating or recalling some value, or for making some determination.

* When the items you are cooking start to smell like food, they are nearly done.
* If you apply your brakes on the highway and the cars around you aren't doing the same, you were likely driving too quickly or reacting too slowly.
* The better the hotel, the lower the likelihood of free WiFi in the rooms.
* When you think, "Hey, I'll add some more feeds to my feed reader," go check your todo list instead.
* If there is a phone in the bathroom, you are probably in a very nice hotel.
* If an establishment advertises flavored coffee, their coffee is bad.
* If you are offered a glass of something bubbly while you wait but are not in an eating or drinking establishment, you are about to pay too much for whatever service is on offer.
* When a portion of the interview is conducted in the bathroom, you've got the job.
