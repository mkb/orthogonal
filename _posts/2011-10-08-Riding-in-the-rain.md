Since the rainy season is upon us once again, I'm dusting off an old blurb about riding in the rain.

# Riding in the rain

For many of us, today is the first rain ride of the season.  If you aren't used to riding in the rain, here are a few things to remember:

* Dress the part.  Riding in the rain can be really enjoyable if you aren't too cold and wet.
* Slow down.
* Be smooth.
* Avoid metal in the road:  manhole covers, big steel plates, muni tracks, etc.  They are very slippery.
* Also watch out for the paint used for road markings.  They can be much more slick than you expect.
* If you really must traverse some metal, cross it as close to 90 degrees as you can manage.  Avoid turning, braking, or changing the throttle while you are on a slippery surface.
* If you slide, don't do anything drastic.  Don't chop the throttle or nail the brakes.  Keep your cool.  The bike will usually right itself.
* Stay loose and relaxed.

## What does "smooth" mean?

Riding smoothly avoiding abrupt changes.  As you apply the brakes or throttle, as you steer, every motion must be controlled and graceful.  Jerky movements make it harder for your tires to grip the pavement and keep you upright.  Remaining upright is more or less the name of the game.
