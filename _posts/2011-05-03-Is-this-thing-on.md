title: Is this thing on?
---
Just for giggles I decided to throw up a site at orthogonal.org, the domain I use for my primary email.

The work has been slow-going since I had the bright idea to learn a slew of technologies in the process:  Jekyll, CSS3, SASS, Compass, and Blueprint.  Given that I spend much of my professional life avoiding what we propellerheads call "the presentation layer," I thought a little recreational exploration of same might do me good, or at least keep me out of trouble.

Much work remains to make the site look good, but it seems to more or less function at this point.  What better motivator to keep working than the knowledge that my friends and relations can see the site as it stands now?

Future tasks, in no particular order:

* HTML/CSS/Atom validation.
* Automated upload.
* Consolidate Compass & Jekyll watchers.
* Autotest integration.
* Spend countless hours playing with the typography until I don't hate it.
* Proper 404 page. âˆš
* Links to relevant sites.
* Feedburner integration.
* Separate atom feeds for updates and new content.
* Modularize the layouts.
* Consider moving layouts to HAML.
* Smart quotes (via SmartyPants?)
* Re-enable CSS compression.
* Mobile friendly.
* Look through old blog posts for content worth including.

That is all I have to say at this time.
