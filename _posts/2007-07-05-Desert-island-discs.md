title: Desert island discs
---

Suppose you are about to be stranded on a desert island for a long time.  You get to bring 10 albums (vinyl or CD) with you.  What ten do you bring?

Here are mine:

1. The Beastie Boys, "Paul's Boutique" - This is an incredible album with lots of subtle detail.  I notice some new nuance every time I put it on.
2. John Coltrane, "John Coltrane Quintet" - Not my favorite 'Trane, but maybe the one I can repeat the most.
3. Steely Dan, "Gaucho" - Oh, to think I once equated this with elevator music!  Sublime.
4. Aphex Twin, "Selected Ambient Works, vol 2" - "Rhubarb" gives me goosebumps.
5. The Beatles, "Abbey Road" - "Come Together" blew my little mind when I was 6 or 7.  These days it's "Something" that comes to mind most often.
6. Yo Yo Ma, "Bach Solo Cello Concertos" - Exquisite.  The Pablo Casals recording is supposed to be definitive, but I'll take this one.
7. Led Zeppelin, "Houses of the Holy" - So many powerful moments, from raucous rockers to darker than The Doors.
8. Wilco, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" - Solid song writing and fucked-up production.  Bumped Plastikman for this due to replay value.
9. Kraftwerk, "Computer World" - Made quite an impression on me just as my love of computers was burgeoning.
10. The Cult, "Beyond Good and Evil" - Their varied catalog made this a tough choice, but my list was short on hard rock, so here it is.

Runners up:  Musik, Back in Black, Praise the Fallen, Axis: Bold as Love.
