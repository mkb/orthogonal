Growl fixes a gaping hole in MacOS X.  Back in the OS 9 days (and at least as far back as OS 7), the Mac had something called the Notification Manager.  OS X is better than its predecessors in almost every way, but the way OS X allows applications running in the background to notify the user that something has happened sucks compared to Notification Manager.

Growl will save you from that.  Growl is a free, open source notification giblet for MacOS X.  Lots of cool software supports Growl.  Apple ought to hand the Growl developers a big pile of money and incorporate Growl into the OS.

If you have a modern Mac and you aren't running Growl, then go get it.  I'll wait here.
